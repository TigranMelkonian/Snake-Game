# Snake-Game
The game has 3 main components: the snake frame, the one that gives the bounds of movement for the snake. the snake body, the objects that will be rezzed depending on the snake's tail length. the snake food which the snake will have to eat in order to grow. ------------------------ this game is still in progress since I need to add a few more features
